# IBM_Main_Project
Main Project For Internship By VTU - Customer Journey Analysis Using Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
📌 Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using clustering techniques to analyze wholesale customer data. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is Wholesale customers data.csv, which contains customer purchase details categorized by region and channel.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-Learn (Clustering, PCA)
SciPy & StatsModels (Statistical Analysis)
🔄 Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values and data types
Mapped categorical values (Region & Channel)
Applied Box-Cox transformation for normalization
Scaled numerical data using MinMaxScaler
Removed outliers using IQR
Clustering Models

K-Means Clustering

Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction
Visualized clusters in 2D
Hierarchical Clustering

Applied Agglomerative Clustering with Ward’s linkage
Visualized clusters using dendrograms
Cluster Analysis

Compared the cluster distributions and mean values
Identified key differences between customer groups
📈 Results
Identified 3 customer segments using K-Means clustering
Visualized clusters using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Compared clustering performance using hierarchical clustering

📌 Key Findings
Different customer segments show varying spending behaviors across product categories.
PCA helps in reducing dimensions while maintaining data variance.
Hierarchical clustering provides an alternative view of customer grouping.
